# Intro

This project created a simple CNN and trained it on the mnist dataset in Keras. 
Final accuracy is 97%. 

This was done using Jupyter Notebook, model was saved and converted to a JS version to run in React. 


Pycharm was used to create the React app. 

The version that runs locally can be checked out using:
git checkout 16c54f65feff6bdefc7f9ce8ead8ee431265e2f8

The version that runs in git pages  can be checked out using:
git checkout df0fee8897de3fdd9681b4ccffe35aacea5da7b2

The Git pages app can be accessed here: https://rossmcmorrow.github.io/CNN-Handwriting-APP/
